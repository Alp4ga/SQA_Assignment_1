## Introduction

### 1.1 Welcome
As a new employee, you will receive a written handbook of best practices.
This document outlines the general best pratices you must follow during the development of a project. Please read it carefully.

### 1.2 Purpose of this Handbook
This Employee Handbook is designed to provide you with information about working
conditions and practices you must follow.
You will learn about Task estimation in scrum process and the coding standards you must follow to help your co-workers understand your code.
The last part is about code reviews, you must keep in touch with your co-workers work.
The information contained in this Handbook applies to all our employees. Following
the policies described in this Handbook is considered a condition of continued
employment. However, nothing in this Handbook alters an employeeâ€™s status.
You are responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with the provisions of
this Handbook. Our objective is to provide you with a positive and safe work
environment.

(Note that it's just as important to highlight bad practices to avoid as good practices to follow. Each section should also contain links to the reference articles for further reading.)

## Coding standards

__Links:__
### 3.1 Topics introduction
### 3.2 Important guidelines
* Easy team integration
* Increased code quality efficiency and easy for maintaining
* Reduce code complexity
* Reduce development cost

* Naming Convention
* File and folder Naming and Organization
* Formatiting and Indentation
* Commenting and Documenting
* Classes and Functions
* Testing
### 3.3 Topics
The developer's world has too much coding standards. It is important in a software development to select the better one. This coding standards depends on the language used i.e., in C++ you will not use the same coding standard than if the language will be in Java or in PHP. It will also depend on the company. You will have three best options, the easiest option is to follow a coding standard which already exists, another way will be to follow a coding standard and make small change because it does not feat with your company rules. The last option will be to create your own coding standards.

The most difficults for a developer is to follow or work with another developer who does not use the same coding standards. During the development you must create new folders and files. It is important to use the same naming convention and folder structure to save as much time as possible when you are looking for a specific file. i.e an asset like a picture or a font.
Read code from someone else can be hard when the naming conventions is not the same. For exemple all class names must be in PascalCase and the variables must be in camelCase. If you use an opposed standards convention for the naming the other person could not understand really fast what your code is supposed to do. Our team will lose time and the development cost will be increased.
When you are working in team on the same project an important part is the testing. Two co-working could be working on the same features and without testing the other co-worker could broke your part without knowing what he is doing. The testing has this role to inssure no one is broking your work with additional code.
All developeurs do not have the same abilities or the same competencies. It is important to commenting and documenting. It will make it easy for the other co-working to understand what is appening in your class, your function, or your package. Without commenting the developer must read and understant the whole concept to work with it. Again, it will increase the time so the development cost.
The identation is also important to increase the readability of the code. A bad identation will render code reaaly hard to follow.

There are no bad coding standards, the important his to follow the same coding standards for the all software development. The coding standard must be defined at the start of the development. Everyone who is working on the project must also follow this coding standard to assure the good work of the software develpment.
