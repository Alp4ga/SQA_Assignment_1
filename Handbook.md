### 2.1 Topics introduction

Coding standards are collections of rules and guidelines that determine the programming style, procedures, and methods for a programming language. Using the right one will help you write cleaner code.
Without the coding conventions, every individual in a team will settle their coding styles. It will not be easy to maintain and debug the code in the near future.

### 2.2 Important guidelines
(Write in bullet points)
### 2.3 Topics
(Note that it's just as important to highlight bad practices to avoid as good practices to follow. Each section should also contain links to the reference articles for further reading.)
